Marfros
Background: Marfros is an Eladrin from the Feywild. 482 years ago, he felt that King Oberon and Queen Titania were passing laws that were taking away too many freedoms of the Fey citizens. He led a rebellion to overthrow the Fey Royal Court that ultimately failed. As penalty for his attempted coup Marfros and many of allies were banished to the kingdom of Lemuria. Marfros was polymorphed into a golden sheep (via a magic collar) and, under an agreement between the Fey Court and King Octavio of Lemuria, was put under the watch of the town of Fleeceton, where he was regularly sheared for his valuable Golden Fleece.
Recent Guild Interactions:
Escape from Fleeceton - In sheep form, Marfros convinced a druid he was being abused by the farmer in Fleeceton. The druid rescued the golden sheep from the farm and the Lemurian Guild was sent in the get the sheep back. The guild team tried to negotiate the release of the sheep and removed the magic collar. Marfros immediately reverted to his Eladrin form and escaped.
Attack on Lemuria - Immediately after his escape from Fleeceton Marfros attacked the capital city of Lemuria with a team of fire and earth elementals. The guild sent multiple teams to stop the attack, but not before the city was heavily damaged.
Recruitment at Colobraro - The city of Colobraro asked the Guild to investigate a recent wave of bad luck. It turned out that a tribe of Quicklings had been gathering in the city for a meeting. The Quicklings were a tribe of Fey that agreed to help Queen Titania fight Marfros but lost their courage and fled the fight. Their punishment was to become very fast but have short life spans (no longer than 10 years). In the meeting, Marfros gave the Quicklings a proposal where they would be messengers for his new rebellion and in return, upon his success he would undo their curse.
Return to the Feywild - In the town of Ketterdam there was a temporary weakness in the veil between the Feywild and Lemuria. Marfros set up 4 ritual sites where human sacrifices would fuel a tear large enough for him to escape back to the Feywild. The guild was sent to disrupt the rituals but Marfros was able to escape. In the conflict Ulgrim and Mistoffelees were killed.
